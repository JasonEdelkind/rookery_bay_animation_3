The snake was transferring itself from beneath the boardwalk onto Mangrove trees. I cannot say what it was, except that it was large around and very heavy as we saw the tree branch bend under it's weight. If it was a python I thought to let you know as it was in the midst of a residential area. Sorry this is so late but we only visit Florida for a shore time each year.

It froze when I parked in front of it with headlights shining on it. I took pictues and then a car drove over it. It then slithered off. It came from what we call ""the north side"" of Collier Seminole State Park, which is wet pine flatwoods with some scrubby and mesic pine flatwoods. It is the 6.5 mile trail entrance to the park. It went across the road to a saltmarsh, that is mainly fresh this time of year. ","","Y","","","","","","","injured by car","","",-81.5800634415342,25.9878131238038
